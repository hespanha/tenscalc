\title{\sc \CS \\[1em]\Large A \matlab{} Class for Compiled Sparse Computations}
\author{\jph}
\date{December 8, 2018}

\begin{document}                        \maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  This class enables very fast repeated computations of (potentially
  sparse) tensors (i.e., multi-dimensional arrays). The speed gains
  are enabled by (i) detecting at compile time the (structural)
  sparsity patterns of the final results and also of all intermediate
  variables, (ii) determining at compile time all the memory indexing
  to access the sparse arrays (iii) performing at initialization time
  all the memory allocation needed for the intermediate results, (iv)
  reusing as much as possible previously used computations, (v)
  performing most of the run-time computations by optimized C
  functions.

\section{Phylosophy}

We start by introducing the key concepts behind \CS{} that
differentiate this tool from ``standard'' \matlab-to-C compilers.

\subsection{When to use \CS?}

The \CS{} class is used when one needs to perform computations
involving tensors (i.e., multi-dimensional arrays) and results in very
significant gains in computation speed in any of the following scenarios:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{en:sparse} The final results or some of the intermediate
  computations involve tensors that are structurally sparse (i.e.,
  with many entries that are equal to zero); e.g.,
  \lstinline{C=A.*diag(b)} (where \lstinline{b} is a vector).

  An entry of a tensor is said to be \emph{structurally zero} if once
  can (symbolically) guarantee that it is always zero; e.g., as in the
  non-diagonal entries of \lstinline{diag(b)}. \emph{Structural
    sparsity}, refers to the pattern of entries of a tensor that are
  structurally zero.

\item \label{en:intermediate} One needs to perform several tensor
  computations that share intermediate results that can be
  reused; e.g. \lstinline{C=A*B+C;D=A*B-C}.

\item \label{en:iterations} One needs to perform the same computation
  multiple times and one can reuse intermediate results from one
  computation to the next; e.g., \lstinline{for i=1:5; C=C+A*B; end}.

\item One needs to perform the same computation multiple times and
  therefore one can reuse previously allocated memory from one
  computation to the next; e.g., \lstinline{for i=1:5; C=C+rand(N); end}.

\item One needs to perform the computation using C code that does
  not use specialized libraries.
\end{enumerate}
While illustrative, the examples under items
\ref{en:sparse}--\ref{en:iterations} above are sufficiently simple
that it would be straighforward to optimize the \matlab{} code to take
advantage of the special structures of the expressions. The goal of
the \CS{} class is to do this automatically for much more complicated
expression.

\subsection{\CS{} compile-time optimization}

The CS{} class takes as inputs a collection of \TC{} symbolic
tensor-valued expressions (STVEs) and generates C code to evaluate
these expressions. The code generation process performs two important
operations at \emph{compile time} to enable very fast \emph{run-time}
evaluation of the STVEs:
\begin{enumerate}
\item It detects the \emph{structural sparsity patterns} of the STVEs
  to be computed, as well as the sparsity patterns of all intermediate
  expressions needed to evaluate the STVEs. This permits the discovery
  (at compile time) of the total memory that needs to be allocated to
  perform all the computations and also to precompute all the indexing
  needed to access the sparse multi-dimensional arrays in memory.

\item It breaks all the computations into elementary operations and
  builds a \emph{dependency tree} for these operations to determine
  all the computations that can be resused from the computation of one
  STVE to another, within a single STVE, or across successive
  computations of the same set of STVEs.\footnote{The dependency tree
    could also be used to distribute computation among several
    processors/threads, but currently this is not done and a single
    thread is used.}
\end{enumerate}

\section{\CS{} declarations}

The C code generated uses a single continuous one-dimensional array to
store all the (nonzero) entries of all the \TC{} tensors with input
data, all the intermediate computations, and the output data. We call
this array the \emph{scratchboard}.

\medskip

The following \CS{} functions are used to determine which STVEs one
wants to specify which STVEs one wants to compute, which \TC{}
variables should be regarded as input parameters. These declarations
implicitely allocate blocks of the scratchbook to all the \TC{}
tensors needed to perform the computations.

\begin{command}{csparse}
\begin{lstlisting}
code=csparse();
\end{lstlisting}
\end{command}

This function returns an empty \CS{} object that will eventually be
compiled into run-time code (after adding STVEs to it). The
scratchbook associated with this object is initially empty.

\begin{command}{declareSet}
\begin{lstlisting}
declareSet(code,STVE,'funname',helpmsg);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{command}

This function adds the given \TC{} STVE to the \CS{} object
\lstinline{code}, specifying that the STVE should be regarded as an
input variable to be provided externally to the run-time \CS{}
code. \lstinline{STVE} is taken to be a \emph{structurally full}
tensor in the sense that all its entries are assumed to be
nonzero.

\medskip

The function \lstinline{declareSet} implicitly requests the creation
of a C function \lstinline{void funname(double *inputData)} that takes
a pointer \lstinline{inputData} to a (non-sparse) tensor with input
data and copies this data to an appropriate location in the
scratchboard for subsequent computations. This C function keeps track
in run-time of which entries of the scratchboard have been modified to
determine which (dependent) entries of the scratchboard need to be
subsequently recomputed.

\medskip

If a matlab class is created to wrap all the \CS{} code, the (optional)
argument \lstinline{helpmsg} is used to create the help for the method
associated with the function \lstinline{void funname(double *inputData)}.

\medskip

Typically, \lstinline{STVE} is a \TC() \lstinline{Tvariables} or some
direct indexing of a \lstinline{Tvariables}, as in
\begin{lstlisting}
% MATLAB declarations 
Tvariable x [5]
Tvariable y [5]
z = 2*(x+y)
declareSet(code,x,'setX') 
declareSet(code,y(1:3),'setY13') 
declareSet(code,y(4:5),'setY45') 
\end{lstlisting}
  which could be used to eventually create code that compute
  $2*(x+y)$ using the collowing C code
\begin{lstlisting}
// C code
double x[5],y13[3],y45[2];
// ... code to compute x, y13, y45 goes here ...
setX(&x);
setY(&y13);
setY(&y45);
// ... code to retrieve z from the scratchbook goes here (see declareGet())
\end{lstlisting}
  STVEs that are more general \TC{} expressions may lead to
  ``unexpected'' results: e.g., with
\begin{lstlisting}
% MATLAB declarations 
Tvariable x [5]
Tvariable y [5]
z = 2*(x+y)
declareSet(x+y,'setX_plus_Y') 
\end{lstlisting}
  the C function \lstinline{setX_plus_Y()} allows one to set directly
  the intermediate expression $x+y$, which is then doubled to obtain
  $z$ (without ever adding $x$ and $y$). However, in the
  ``apparently similar'' code
\begin{lstlisting}
% MATLAB declarations 
Tvariable x [5]
Tvariable y [5]
z = 2*x+2*y
declareSet(x+y,'setX_plus_Y') 
\end{lstlisting}
  the C function \lstinline{setX_plus_Y()} allows one to set values in
  the scratchbook for the expression $x+y$, but the computation of $z$
  does not explicitely use $x+y$ so by setting the value of $x+y$ this
  does not affect the value of $z$. This arises because no attempt is
  mode within \TC{} or \CS{} to identify $2*(x+y)$ with $2*x+2*y$. In
  fact, these toolbox do not recognize many algebraic rule (including
  the distributivity rule, etc.). However, they do recognize a few
  rules (including the roles of the multiplicative and additive
  identities and some forms of commutativity and associativity). Since
  the user cannot be sure of what types of symbolic manipulations will
  be done internally, one may get ``unpredictable'' behavior when
  \lstinline{STVE} in the \lstinline{declareSet} is not a
  \lstinline{Tvariables} or some direct indexing of a
  \lstinline{Tvariables}

\begin{command}{declareGet}
\begin{lstlisting}
declareGet(code,STVE,'funname',helpmsg);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{command}

This function adds the given \TC{} STVE to the \CS{} object
\lstinline{code}, specifying that the STVE should be regarded as an
output variable to be computed by the run-time \CS{}
code. \lstinline{STVE} must be a \emph{structurally full}\footnote{The
  current implementation of \CS{} actually allows
  \lstinline{declareGet} to be called with a sparse STVE for
  2-dimensional tensors. However, this has not been tested.} tensor in
the sense that all its entries are assumed to be nonzero. If that is
not the case, one can always use
\begin{lstlisting}
declareGet(code,full(STVE),'funname',helpmsg);
\end{lstlisting}
where the \lstinline{full} operator ``fills-in'' any structurally
nonzero entries. 

\medskip

The function \lstinline{declareGet} implicitly requests the creation
of a C function \lstinline{void funname(double *outputBuffer)} that
that performs any required recomputations needed to obtain the value
of \lstinline{STVE} and copies the corresponding locations of the
scratchbook to \lstinline{outputBuffer}. This C function keeps track
of which entries of the scratchbook have been modified (by previous
calls to C functions generated by \lstinline{declareGet} and
\lstinline{declareCopy}) to make sure that a minimum ammount of
scratchbook entries are recomputed.

\medskip

If a matlab class is created to wrap all the \CS{} code, the (optional)
argument \lstinline{helpmsg} is used to create the help for the method
associated with the function \lstinline{void funname(double *outputBuffer)}.

\begin{command}{declareCopy}
\begin{lstlisting}
declareCopy(code,STVEdest,STVEsrc,'funname',helpmsg);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{command}

This function adds the given \TC{} STVEs to the \CS{} object
\lstinline{code}. The given STVEs may be full or sparse, but in the
latter case they need to have the same exact structural sparsity
pattern. 

\medskip

The function \lstinline{declareCopy} implicitly requests the creation
of a C function \lstinline{void funname()} that copies the value of
\lstinline{STVEsrc} in the scratcbook to the location of
\lstinline{STVEdest} in the scratchbook. Like the C functions created
by \lstinline{declareGet}, this C function keeps track of which
entries of the scratchbook have been modified (by previous calls to C
functions generated by declareGet and declareCopy) to make sure that a
minimum ammount of scratchbook entries are recomputed. In addition,
like the C functions created by \lstinline{declareSet}, this C
function keeps track in run-time of which entries of the scratchboard
have been modified to determine which (dependent) entries of the
scratchboard need to be subsequently recomputed. 

\medskip

If a matlab class is created to wrap all the \CS{} code, the (optional)
argument \lstinline{helpmsg} is used to create the help for the method
associated with the function \lstinline{void funname()}.

\medskip

As with \lstinline{declareSet}, care must be exercise when the
destination STVE \lstinline{STVEdest} are not \lstinline{Tvariable}.

\medskip

Unlike \lstinline{declareSet} and \lstinline{declareGet},
\lstinline{declareCopy} may operate on groups of tensors, i.e.,
\lstinline{STVEsrc} and \lstinline{STVEdest} may be cell arrays of
STVEs. This is important because the copy is carried out atomically
without regard to dependencies betweem the tensors in the group. To
understand this consider the two alternative \matlab{} declarations
and the corresponding C code that calls the copy functions so
generated:
\begin{lstlisting}
% MATLAB declarations
declareCopy(code,{A2,B2},{A1,B1},'copyA1B1toA2B2');
\\ C code
copyA1B1toA2B2();
\end{lstlisting}
and
\begin{lstlisting}
% MATLAB declarations
declareCopy(code,A2,A1,'copyA1toA2');
declareCopy(code,B2,B1,'copyB1toB2');
\\ C code
copyA1toB1();
copyA2toB2();
\end{lstlisting}
In the first option \lstinline{copyA1B1toA2B2()} starts by
(re)computing \lstinline{A1,B1}, then makes the copy, and finally
marks \lstinline{A2,B2} as having been modified (which eventually may
trigger other computations). In the second option
\lstinline{copyA1toB1();copyA2toB2();} starts by (re)computing
\lstinline{A1}, then makes the copy of the value of \lstinline{A1} to
\lstinline{A2}, then marks \lstinline{A2} as modified, and only after
that re(computes) \lstinline{B2} --- potentially taking into account
the changes made to \lstinline{A2}.

\begin{command}{declareAlias}
\begin{lstlisting}
[SVTEout]=declareAlias(code,STVE,'name');
[SVTEout]=declareAlias(code,STVE,'name',atomic);
[SVTEout,subscripts]=declareAlias(code,STVE,'name');
\end{lstlisting}
\end{command}

This function adds the given \TC{} STVE to the \CS{} object
\lstinline{code} without declaring it an input or output variable, but
returns a \TC{} STVE \lstinline{Tvariable} called
\lstinline{name} that is linked to the value of \lstinline{STVE} in
the scratchbook. 

\medskip

When called with more than 1 output argument, the sparsity structure
of the tensor \lstinline{STVE} is returned in \lstinline{subscripts},
which is a matrix with one row per dimension of the tensor
\lstinline{STVE} and one column per structurally nonzero entry of
\lstinline{STVE}. Each column of \lstinline{subscripts} contains the
subscripts of a structurally nonzero entry of \lstinline{STVE}.

\paragraph*{Atomic operations}

When the boolean input parameter \lstinline{atomic} is
\lstinline{true}, the C-code used to compute the top operator of the
STVEs will not store its output tensor entries in the
scratchbook. Instead, its output will be dynamically
allocated/deallocated as a block. This has several consequences:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The operator's output is not stored statically in the
  scratchbook. Instead, each time it needs to be recomputed, memory is
  allocated to store its value. In case a previous version of the
  computation existed in memory, it is freed prior to allocating the
  memory for the new computation.

\item Atomic operators can be computed by algorithms for which the
  sparsity structure of the result cannot be determined at compile
  time, such as the LU factorization of a sparse matrix with pivoting
  adapted to the specific matrix.

\item Atomic operators are always recomputed as a whole, even if only
  a small subset of its operands have changed.
\end{enumerate}
Declaring an operator as \emph{atomic} will not affect the generation
of \matlab{} code.

\paragraph*{Working with aliases.}

Aside from learning at compile time the structural sparsity pattern of
\lstinline{STVE} (when called with multiple output arguments), the
main use of \lstinline{declareAlias} is to obtain a ``simple''
\TC{} \lstinline{Tvariable} that represents a (potentially very
complex) \TC{} expression, which reduces the overhead of subsequent
\TC{} symbolic manipulations. To understand this, consider the
following declaration
\begin{lstlisting}
% MATLAB declarations
J=norm2(A*x-b);
g=gradient(J,x);
z=g(1:3)-g(4:6); (*\label{li:z-big}*)
declareGet(code,z,'getZ')
\end{lstlisting}
which results in the following values of the \TC{} STVEs
\begin{lstlisting}
g=mytprod(A,[1,-1],x,[-1])-b,[-1],A,[-1, 1]);   % same as A'*(A*x-b)
z= subsref(mytprod(2,[],mytprod(A,[1,-1],x,[-1])-b,[-1],A,[-1, 1]),...
           struct('type','()','subs',{{(1:3)}}))...
  -subsref(mytprod(2,[],mytprod(A,[1,-1],x,[-1])-b,[-1],A,[-1, 1]),...
           struct('type','()','subs',{{(4:6)}}))
\end{lstlisting}
where one can see the gradient appearing twice in \lstinline{z}. In
spite of this, \TC{} is ``smart enough'' to detect the duplication and
generates code tha does not compute the gradient twice when it
evaluates \lstinline{z}. Nevertheless, \TC{} STVEs tend to grow
rapidly and their processing results can result in large overhead ---
at compile time, not at run time!

\medskip

Unwieldy \TC{} STVEs can be avoided in \lstinline{declareAlias},
as in
\begin{lstlisting}
% MATLAB declarations
J=norm2(A*x-b);
g=gradient(J,x);  (*\label{li:g}*)
g=declareAlias(code,g,'z');
z=g(1:3)-g(4:6); (*\label{li:z-small}*)
declareGet(code,z,'getZ')
\end{lstlisting}
which results in the following values of the \TC{} STVEs
\begin{lstlisting}
g=mytprod(A,[1,-1],x,[-1])-b,[-1],A,[-1, 1]);   % same as A'*(A*x-b)
z=g(1:3)-g(4:6); 
\end{lstlisting}
with the understanding that \CS{} internally knows that \lstinline{g}
is actually given by the expression in line \ref{li:g} and will take
that into account in the generation of any C code. However, as far as
\TC{} goes \lstinline{g} is a freshly created new variable, unrelated
to \lstinline{A}, \lstinline{x}, or \lstinline{b}.

\medskip

Two items must be taken into account:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The link between the input STVE \lstinline{STVE} and the output
  STVE \lstinline{STVEout} is known to the \CS{} object
  \lstinline{code}, but the dependence of \lstinline{STVEout} with
  respect to other variables that appear in \lstinline{STVE} is unkown
  to \TC{}.

  This affects \TC{}'s ability to perform some symbolic
  manipulations. E.g., \lstinline{gradient(z,x)} will return
  \lstinline{A'*A} when \lstinline{z} is computed using line
  \ref{li:z-big}, but will return 0 when \lstinline{z} is computed
  using line \ref{li:z-small}.
  
\item Space will be reserved in the scrapbook to hold the tensor
  \lstinline{STVE} and all the intermediate tensors needed to compute
  it, regardless of whether or not this tensor is needed for the C
  functions generated by \lstinline{declareSet} and
  \lstinline{declareGet}, \lstinline{declareCopy}. \joao{One should
    probably eventually do some ``garbage collection'' within the
    scratchbook before generating code to (i) removed entries that are
  not called by any C function and (ii) reuse scrapbook memory.}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{command}{declareSave}
\begin{lstlisting}
declareSave(code,STVE,'funname','filename_subscripts');
\end{lstlisting}
\end{command}

This function adds the given \TC{} STVE to the \CS{} object
\lstinline{code} and writes the sparsity structure of the STVE to a
(binary) file called \lstinline{filename_subscripts}. 

\medskip

The function \lstinline{declareSave} implicitely request the creation
of a C function \lstinline{void funname(char *filename_values)} that
writes to a (binary) file called \lstinline{filename_values} the
values in the scrapbook corresponding to the given STVE. Opposite to
the C function created by \lstinline{declareGet}, the C function
created by \lstinline{declareSave} \emph{does not} trigger any
recomputations of values in the scrapbook; it simply write the current
values in the scrapbook. 

\medskip

The structures of the files \lstinline{filename_subscripts} and
\lstinline{filename_values} are described in
Tables~\ref{tab:subscripts-file} and \ref{tab:values-file},
respectively. These files can be read using the \CS{} command
\begin{lstlisting}
[subscripts,values]=loadCSparse(filename_subscripts,filename_values)
\end{lstlisting}
The filename can also be passed to the \TC{} function \lstinline{lu}
as a ``typical'' value for the matrix to be factorized. This
``typical'' value is used by \CS{} to determine ``optimal'' pivoting,
row/column permutations (and potentially scaling\footnote{Not yet
  implemented.}).

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \caption{Structure of the binary file \lstinline{filename\_subscripts}.}
  \begin{tabular}{p{.1\textwidth}p{.3\textwidth}p{.5\textwidth}}
    \hline
    name  & length & description\\\hline
    magic & {1 x sizeof(int64\_t)} & random number that is common to
    {filename\_subscripts} and {filename\_values}
    that can be used to make sure the the two files are compatible\\

\end{table}

    the order the subscripts appear in the file {filename\_subscripts}.\\\hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab:values-file}
\end{table}


\begin{command}{declareFunction}
\begin{lstlisting}
declareFunction(code,'filename.c','funname',defines,inputs,outputs,method,helpmsg);
declareFunction(code,'filename.m','funname',defines);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{command}



This functions adds to the \CS{} object \lstinline{code} a C function
(first form) or a \matlab{} function (second form). This function does
not operate directly on the scrapbook, but will typically call C
functions created through \lstinline{declareSet},
\lstinline{declareGet}, \lstinline{declareCopy}, and
\lstinline{declareSave}. The function can be found in the file
\lstinline{filename.c}/\lstinline{filename.m} and is called
\lstinline{functionName()}.  For \matlab{} functions, the 1st function
in the file will be changed to \lstinline{unctionName()}, if that was
not the case.

\medskip

For \matlab{} functions, the structure \lstinline{defines} specifies a
set of constants that will be included in the class and can be used to
pass parameters to the matlab function, as in:
\begin{lstlisting}
defines.name1 = value
defines.name2 = value
\end{lstlisting}

For C functions, the function declared is of type \lstinline{void funname()} with its input parameters defined by the structure arrays 
\lstinline{inputs} and \lstinline{outputs}, respectively, according to
the following templates: 
\begin{lstlisting}
inputs(1).name = {string with the name of the variable}
inputs(1).type = {string describing the matlab input type as in
                  (uint8|uint16|uint32|uint64|int8|int16|int32|int64|float|double)}
inputs(1).size = {numeric array with the size of matrix}
inputs(2).type = ...
   ...
outputs(1).name = {string with the name of the variable}
outputs(1).type = {string describing the matlab input type as in
                  (uint8|uint16|uint32|uint64|int8|int16|int32|int64|float|double)}
outputs(1).size = {numeric array with the size of matrix}
outputs(2).type = ...
\end{lstlisting}
All inputs and outputs are passed by reference, with all the inputs
first, followed by the outputs.  The structure \lstinline{defines}
specifies a set of \lstinline{#define} pre-processor directives that
should precede the C function definition and can be used to pass
(hardcoded) parameters to the C function, according to the following
templates:
\begin{lstlisting}
defines.name1 = {string or scalar}
defines.name2 = {string or scalar}
   ...
\end{lstlisting}



\begin{command}{saveVectorized}
\begin{lstlisting}
saveVectorized(code,filename);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{command}

This function saves the \CS{} object as a computational graph whose
nodes are functions that operate on STVEs, using the format described
in \texttt{computationalGraphs.pdf}. The filenames for the different
files are constructed from \lstinline{filename}, which should not have
an extension.


\begin{command}{class2compute}
\begin{lstlisting}
  \texttt{[...]=class2compute('parameter name 1',value,'parameter name 2',value,...);}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{command}

Creates a set of matlab functions for performing a \CS{}
computation. The computation is performed through a \matlab{} class
with methods to call the functions declared using
\lstinline{declareSet}, \lstinline{declareGet},
\lstinline{declareCopy}, \lstinline{declareSave}, and
\lstinline{declareFunction}.

\paragraph{Input parameters:}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{minInstructions4loop} [default \texttt{100}]

   Minimum number of similar instruction that will be execute as part of a   
for(;;) loop, rather than being executed as independent C commands.   
When equal to 'inf', instructions will never be grouped into foor loops.   
    
This parameter is only used for C-code solvers.

\item \texttt{csparseObject}

   csparse object with computations to be performed.

\item \texttt{classname} [default \texttt{<to be determined from the pedigree >}]

   Name of the class to be created.   
A matlab class will be created with this name plus a \texttt{.m} extension.   
    
One can look "inside" this class to find the name of the cmex functions.

\item \texttt{folder} [default \texttt{'.'}]

   Path to the folder where the files will be created.   
Needs to be in the Matlab path.

\item \texttt{profiling} [default \texttt{false}] taking values in [\texttt{true},\texttt{false}]

   When \texttt{true}, adds profiling to the C code.   
    
Accumulated profiling information is diplayed on the screen when the   
dynamic library is unloaded.   
    
This parameter is only used for C-code solvers.

\item \texttt{absolutePath} [default \texttt{true}] taking values in [\texttt{true},\texttt{false}]

   When 'true' the the cmex functions use an absolute path to open   
the dynamic library, which means that the dynamic library cannot   
be moved away from the folder where it was created.   
    
When 'false' no path information about the dynamic library is   
included in the cmex function, which must then rely on the OS-specific   
method used to find dynamic libraries. See documentation of 'dlopen'   
for linux and OSX or 'LoadLibrary' for Microsoft Windows.   
    
This parameter is used only when 'callType'='dynamicLibrary'.   
    
This parameter is only used for C-code solvers.

\item \texttt{compilerOptimization} [default \texttt{'-Ofast'}] taking values in [\texttt{'-O0'},\texttt{'-O1'},\texttt{'-O2'},\texttt{'-O3'},\texttt{'-Ofast'}]

\section{Run-time Considerations}

The existence of the scratchboard is transparent to the user, who does
not need to worry about where in the scratchboard values will be
stored or how they are addressed. Because of this, the user does not
need to pass any information about scratchboard locations to the
functions \lstinline{declareSet}, \lstinline{declareGet}, and
\lstinline{declareCopy}. Obviously, \CS{} object internally keep
track of where everything is in the scratchboard.

\medskip

From the C-code prespective, the scratchboard is an one-dimensional
array of floating point variables (typically double for matlab
compatility) that is accessed by all the run-time C functions as a
global variable. The whole array can either be declared as a global
variable or it can be allocated in run time using
\lstinline{malloc}. In the latter case, two C functions named
\lstinline{initializer()} and \lstinline{finalizer()} are generated to
allocate the scratchbook and deallocate it, respectively; and any
calls to the C functions generated through \lstinline{declareSet},
\lstinline{declareGet}, and \lstinline{declareCopy} must be made
between calls to \lstinline{initializer()} and
\lstinline{finalizer()}. Aside from the scratchbook, a few more global
variables are used to keep track of scratchbook dependencies.

\section{Quick Start}

The best way to learn how to use \CS{} is through the examples
\lstinline{examples/csparse/tutorialLQ.m},
\lstinline{examples/csparse/tutorialFIM.m}, \lstinline{examples/csparse/tutorialNN.m}.  

\medskip

The following code demonstrates the use \CS through a lower-level
interface than those in the examples above. The use of this interface
is discouraged at this time.

\subsection{Standalone C code}

We first show how to use \CS{} to create a standalone C program that
solves a simple optimization using gradient descent.

\medskip

We start by defining the dimensions of the variables an constants to
be used later:
\begin{lstlisting}
N=10000;
n=800;
b=rand(N,1);
\end{lstlisting}
We are now ready to define the \TC{} STVEs that we want to compile. To
do this one uses \lstinline{Tvariable} to define symbolic variables,
which one can then use in several matlab functions that have been
redefined to accept such variables. The new function
\lstinline{gradient} permits symbolic differentiation. At this time no
computations are performed.
\begin{lstlisting}
Tvariable A [N,n];
Tvariable x n;
y=A*x-b;
J=norm2(y);
grad=gradient(J,x);
ngrad2=norm2(grad);
xx=x-.1/(N*n)*grad;
\end{lstlisting}
The next step is to define the computations that we want to
compile. The class \lstinline{csparse} is used for this purpose, with
the methods \lstinline{declareSet} used to declare input variables and
expressions that we want to compile, \lstinline{declareGet} to declare
the output variables that we want to compute, and
\lstinline{declareCopy} to declare assignments between variables that
we want to do in run-time. 
\begin{lstlisting}
code=csparse();
declareSet(code,A,'setA');           % ask for function to set value of A
declareSet(code,x,'setX');           % ask for function to set value of x
declareGet(code,J,'getJ');           % ask for function to get value of J
declareGet(code,x,'getX');           % ask for function to set value of xx
declareGet(code,ngrad2,'getNgrad2'); % ask for function to get value of getNgrad2
declareCopy(code,x,xx,'copyXx2X');   % ask for a function to copy value of xx to x
\end{lstlisting}
The method \lstinline{compile2C} now generates the appropriate C code:
\begin{lstlisting}
!rm -f tmpC_docStandAlone.c          % erase previous version since compile2C appends
compile2C(code,'tmpC_docStandAlone.c');
\end{lstlisting}
Finally, the computations are ready to be performed within a C
program, e.g., using the following standalone code:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#include <stdlib.h> // needed for rand()
#include "tmpC_docStandAlone.c"

#define N 100
#define n 8

int main()
{
  double A[N*n],x[n],J,ngrad2,gamma=.1;
  int i;
  
  for (i=0;i<N*n;i++) A[i]=(double)rand()/(double)RAND_MAX;
  for (i=0;i<n;i++) x[i]=(double)rand()/(double)RAND_MAX;

  printf("Before:\n");
  getNgrad2(&ngrad2);   
  getJ(&J);             
  printf("  ngrad2 = %10lf, J = %10lf\n",ngrad2,J);

  for (i=0;;i++) {
    getNgrad2(&ngrad2);
    if (ngrad2<1e-3) break;
    copyXx2X();
  } 

  printf("After %d iterations:\n",i);
  getX(x); 
  for (i=0;i<n;i++) 
    printf("  x[%3d] = %10lf\n",i,x[i]);
  getNgrad2(&ngrad2);   
  getJ(&J);             
  printf("  ngrad2 = %10lf, J = %10lf\n",ngrad2,J);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{C-code called from \matlab{}}

We now show how to use \CS{} to create a cmex \matlab{} function that
solves the same simple oprimization using gradient descent. The cmex
function now takes the input data from \matlab{} variable and returns
the result also to \matlab{} variables. To accomplish this we use the
\CMEX{} toolbox.

\medskip

The following \CMEX{} template does the trick:
\begin{lstlisting}
#ifdef createGateway

function tmpC_docCmex       % name of the cmex (gateway) function
Cfunction docCmex_raw       % function called by the gateway for the computations
include docCmex.c           % include this function before the gateway

inputs                      % inputs to the cmex function
      double A[N,n]
      double x0[n]
outputs                     % outputs of the cmex function
      double J[1]
      double x[n]

preprocess(N,n,b)           % matlab code executed before creating the gateway function
     Tvariable A [N,n];
     Tvariable x n;

     y=A*x-b;
     J=norm2(y);
     grad=gradient(J,x);
     ngrad2=norm2(grad);
     xx=x-.1/(N*n)*grad;

     code=csparse();
     declareSet(code,A,'setA');           % ask for function to set value of A
     declareSet(code,x,'setX');           % ask for function to set value of x
     declareGet(code,J,'getJ');           % ask for function to get value of J
     declareGet(code,x,'getX');           % ask for function to set value of xx
     declareGet(code,ngrad2,'getNgrad2'); % ask for function to get value of getNgrad2
     declareCopy(code,x,xx,'copyXx2X');   % ask for a function to copy value of xx to x

     compile2C(code,'tmpC_docCmex.c');    % to be appended to the gateway function
#endif

void docCmex_raw(/* inputs */
                 double *A,
                 double *x0,
                 /* outputs */
                 double *J,
                 double *x,
                 /* sizes */
                 mwSize N,
                 mwSize n)
{
  double ngrad2;
  int i;

  setA(A);
  setX(x0);

  printf("Before:\n");
  for (i=0;i<n;i++) 
    printf("  x[%3d] = %10lf\n",i,x[i]);
  getNgrad2(&ngrad2);   
  getJ(J);             
  printf("  ngrad2 = %10lf, J = %10lf\n",ngrad2,J);

  for (i=0;;i++) {
    getNgrad2(&ngrad2);
    if (ngrad2<1e-3) break;
    copyXx2X();
  } 
  printf("After %d iterations:\n",i);
  getX(x); 
  for (i=0;i<n;i++) 
    printf("  x[%3d] = %10lf\n",i,x[i]);
  getNgrad2(&ngrad2);   
  getJ(J);             
  printf("  ngrad2 = %10lf, J = %10lf\n",ngrad2,J);
}
\end{lstlisting}
The following matlab code uses \CMEX{} to create the cmex function and
then calls it:
\begin{lstlisting}
N=100;
n=8;
b=rand(N,1);

createGateway('template','docCmex.c',... % template describing the cmex function
              'compile',true,...
              'preprocessParameters',{N,n,b});

A=rand(N,n);
x0=rand(n,1);

[J,x]=tmpC_docCmex(A,x0);
\end{lstlisting}




\subsection{Matlab class}

Alternatively\footnote{Not (yet?) implemented.}, by using
\begin{lstlisting}
compile2matlab(code,'tmpM_testDoc.m');
\end{lstlisting}
instead of the above \lstinline{compile2C} command, one can generate a
\matlab{} class to perform the same computions from within \matlab{},
e.g., using the following code:
\begin{lstlisting}
obj=tmpC_testDoc();
setA(obj,rand(N,n));
x=zeros(n,1);
setX(obj,x);
 while 1
   ngrad=getNgrad(obj);
   if sqrt(ngrad)<1e-3, break; end
   copyXx2X(obj);
 end
j=getJ(obj);
\end{lstlisting}
